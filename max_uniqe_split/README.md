# 1593. Split a String Into the Max Number of Unique Substrings

<https://leetcode.com/problems/split-a-string-into-the-max-number-of-unique-substrings/description>

Given a string `s`, return _the maximum number of unique substrings that the given string can be split into_.

You can split string `s` into any list of __non-empty substrings__, where the concatenation of the substrings forms the original string. However, you must split the substrings such that all of them are __unique__.

A __substring__ is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
